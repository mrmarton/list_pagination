# UNIT2
In this project, you'll enhance the usability of a web page that is displaying way too much information all at once. Long lists don't make for a good user experience on a web page. To make it easier for the user to find information and read the page, you'll add to this project a popular web development technique known as "pagination".

I used the power of Google, stackoverflow and w3 for this project.
