# UNIT2
In this project, you'll enhance the usability of a web page that is displaying way too much information all at once. Long lists don't make for a good user experience on a web page. To make it easier for the user to find information and read the page, you'll add to this project a popular web development technique known as "pagination".

I used the power of Google, stackoverflow and w3 for this project.
# list_pagination
Displaying a long list of items on a web page, like a list of 200 movie titles or 400 products, can overwhelm a user with too much information at once. A common solution is to display a handful of items on one page and provide navigation to jump to a list of more items. In this project, you'll write JavaScript to divide a long list into a series of "pages" and improve the user experience of a web page.
